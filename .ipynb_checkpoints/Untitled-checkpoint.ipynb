    "## Principle of Business Model\n",
    "1. Selling more stuff to more people more often for more money more efficiently\n",
    "More stuff: adding products or services\n",
    "More people: more users\n",
    "More often: stickiness, repeated use\n",
    "More money: upselling and maximizing the price users will pay\n",
    "More efficiently: reduce the cost of delivering or supporting, lower the acquisition fee\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some aspects of business model\n",
    "Acquisition channel: how people find out about you\n",
    "Selling tactic: how you convince visitors to become users or users become customers\n",
    "Revenue source: how you make money\n",
    "Product type: what value your business offers in return for the revenue\n",
    "Delivery model：how you get your product to your customer\n",

    "## Models for Several Industries(Game rule)\n",
    "### 1. E-commerce\n",
    "- Keywords are more important since users tend to use search engine and bounce back and forth.\n",
    "- Recommendation engines are used more often\n",
    "- Segmenting traffic\n",
    "- Purchase are far from the website itself. Social network, email, online community will lead to the purchase\n",
    "- Loyalty-focused company try to establish the recurring relationship with their users\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversion Rate**: slice by demographic, copy, referral.  dependent on your type of e-commerce business, and whether your success will be driven by loyalty, new customer acquisition, or a hybrid of the two.\n",
    "- **Purchase per Year**\n",
    "- **Shopping cart size**\n",
    "- **Abandonment**\n",
    "- **Cost of customer acquisition**: shopping cart size can be the indicator of your revenue, since customer acquisition fee is the same.\n",
    "- **Revenue per customer(life time value)**\n",
    "- **Key word and search terms**: search from external site and within your site\n",
    "- **Recommendation acceptance rate**\n",
    "- **Virality**\n",
    "- **Mailing list click through rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Offline**\n",
    "- **Shipping time**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stock availability**\n",
    "\n",
    "**E-Commerce User flow funnel**\n",
    "![alt text](lean_analytics/ec_funnel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- know if you’re focused on loyalty or acquisition.\n",
    "- searches, both off- and on-site, are an increasingly common way of finding something for purchase.\n",
    "- revenue per customer is more important than conversion rates, repeat purchases or transaction sizes.\n",
    "- Don’t overlook real-world considerations like shipping, warehouse logistics, and inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Software as a Service(SaaS)\n",
    "eg: Salesforce, Gmail.\n",
    "- They generally generate revenue from a monthly(or yearly) subscription that users pay.\n",
    "- Offer a tiered model of their service\n",
    "- Since the cost of adding customers is less, they use a freeminum model of customer acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attenntion**: How effectively the business attracts visitors.\n",
    "- **Enrollment**\n",
    "- **Stickiness**: How much the customers use the product.\n",
    "- **Conversion**\n",
    "- **Revenue per customer**\n",
    "- **Customer acquisition cost**\n",
    "- **Virality**\n",
    "- **Upselling**: What makes customers increase their spending, and how often that happens.\n",
    "- **Uptime and reliability**: How many complaints, problem escalations, or outages the company has.\n",
    "- **Churn**: should pick a timespan. track chrun for both not paid and paid users seperately. (define an inactive user as someone who hasn't logged in within 90 days). \n",
    "(number of churns during period) / (# cusomters at beginning of period)\n",
    "- **Churn Complications**: \n",
    "(#churns during period)/((#customer at beginning of period + #customers at end of period)/2)\n",
    "\n",
    "two ways to simplify: 1) measure churn by cohort 2) measure churn each day(shorten the time period)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lifetime Value**\n",
    "- **Engagement**: segment users who do what you want from those who don’t, and identify ways in which they’re\n",
    "different. To decide whether a change worked, test the change on a subset of your\n",
    "users and compare that subset’s results to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SaaS User flow funnel**\n",
    "![alt text](lean_analytics/saas_funnel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The complexity of this model comes from two things: the promotional approach and pricing tiers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**\n",
    "- While freemium(免费增值) gets a lot of visibility, it’s actually a sales tactic, and\n",
    "one you need to use carefully.\n",
    "- In SaaS, churn is everything. If you can build a group of loyal users\n",
    "faster than they erode, you’ll thrive.\n",
    "- You need to measure user engagement long before the users become customers, and measure customer activity long before they vanish, to stay ahead of the game.\n",
    "- Many people equate SaaS models with subscription, but you can monetize on-demand software in many other ways, sometimes to great\n",
    "effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Free Mobile App\n",
    "- the a/b testing is hard to do since mobile apps have to go through the app store gatekeeper, which limits the number of iterations a company can undergo\n",
    "- Some developer advocate trying out the android platform first because it's easier to push frequent updates to users or choose a smaller market to work the bugs out there first\n",
    "- Make money by:\n",
    "    1. Downloadable ontent\n",
    "    2. Flair and customization of in-character appearance and gaming content\n",
    "    3. Advantages(better weapons, upgrades)\n",
    "    4. Saving Time\n",
    "    5. Elimination of countdown timers\n",
    "    6. Upselling to a paid version\n",
    "    7. In-game ads\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Downloads**\n",
    "- **Customer acquisition cost(CAC)**\n",
    "- **Launch Rate**\n",
    "- **Percent of active users/players**: DAU/MAU\n",
    "- **Percentage of users who pay**\n",
    "- **Time to first purchase**\n",
    "- **Monthly average revenue per user(ARPU)**: or ARPPU(the average revenue per paying user)\n",
    "- **Ratings click-through**: The percentage of users who put a rating or a review in an app store\n",
    "- **Virality**\n",
    "- **Churn**\n",
    "- **Customer Lifetime Value**: take months or years for a player to leave you, it's harder to estimate the CLV\n",
    "- **Intallation Volumn**: Getting featured\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**\n",
    "- Mobile apps make their money in a variety of ways.\n",
    "- Most of the money comes from a small number of users; these should be\n",
    "segmented and analyzed as a distinct group. The key metric is average\n",
    "revenue per user, but you may also track the average revenue per paying\n",
    "user, since these “whales” are so distinct.\n",

    "## How to evaluate the metrics \n",
    "**Growth rate**: a good growth rate is 5%-7%. If over 10%, it suggests you are doing very well.\n",
    "**Number of engaged visitors**: • 30% of registered users will use a web-based service at least once a\n",
    "month. For mobile applications, 30% of the people who download the\n",
    "app use it each month.\n",
    "• 10% of registered users will use the service or mobile app every day.\n",
    "• The maximum number of concurrent users will be 10% of the number\n",
    "of daily users."
